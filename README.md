# Project-2

What Works:
- Player can teleport fly and walk through environment as well as jump and turn with right thumbstick
- Enemies wander between waypoints and can detect player and charge to attack
- Player can use sword to parry slash or stab enemies, slash and stab are recognized as different and stabbing is more effective on some fruit where slashing is more effective on others
- Player can reach into toolbelt to swap between shuriken and grappling hook
- Player can throw shuriken to harm enemies and grappling hook to grab them

What does not work:
- Grappling hook sometimes causes enemies to just disappear
- No feedback for attacks on enemies
- Knockback for enemies on attacking player not working
- Enemies can only damage player after certain timer expires between attacks but there is no feedback
